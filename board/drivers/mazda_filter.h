// ---- Host-visible ID gate (Jetson port) ----
//
// The hardware acceptance filters accept EVERYTHING on both buses, because the
// filter sits upstream of can_rx(), and can_rx() is where safety_fwd_hook() does
// the cam<->car forwarding. Anything dropped in silicon is dropped from the
// FORWARD path too -- see the long note in stm32f446/llbxcan.h.
//
// The reason a filter existed at all is the host link, not the buses: the CX-5
// main bus carries ~743 distinct IDs at ~2-3k frames/s, which saturates the
// 1.5 Mbaud serial VCP to the Jetson and overflowed can_rx_q by 1.29M frames.
// So the trim happens here instead -- after forwarding, after the safety hooks,
// immediately before the can_rx_q push.
//
// Bus 0 (car main bus) is gated to the list below. Bus 2 is the isolated camera
// segment -- 11 IDs, a few hundred frames/s -- and reaches the host whole.
//
// The list is exactly what opendbc's Mazda port reads: carstate.py's parser
// signals plus the safety layer's five rx_checks (0x21C, 0x09D, 0x240, 0x202,
// 0x165). Adding an ID here costs host bandwidth only; it has no effect on what
// the car or the camera receive.
//
// The last two are for alpha longitudinal (see opendbc_patches/*_mazda_alpha_long).
// Both are inert until that build is enabled -- they only widen what the host is
// allowed to SEE, never what it may send; the tx side is the safety model's job.

  // RADAR SHADOW, back on purpose. These seven are the radar's OTHER frames --
  // the ones alpha long does not replace -- and their disappearance is the
  // leading explanation for the "front camera sensor" fault. The host has to SEE
  // them to capture them before suppression, and to replay them afterwards.
  //
  // THEY WERE REMOVED ONCE, AND THE REASON STILL STANDS. Measured over one 990 s
  // drive with them present: rx_buffer_overflow 446,577 and resync_bytes 7,217,
  // with the host feed starved to 1 frame/s while CAN1's hardware counter climbed
  // past 2.8M. carState froze -- v pinned at 41.0 kph, steering angle decoding as
  // -1369.6 deg from a torn frame -- for 368 s, which surfaced as wrongCarMode and
  // made openpilot impossible to re-engage after a brake.
  //
  // What changed since: can_thread no longer spins (it polls at ~500 Hz instead of
  // ~5000), and the panda now runs in its own process, so the host drains far more
  // reliably than it did then. That is the reason to try again -- it is NOT proof
  // the budget fits. WATCH rx_buffer_overflow ON THE FIRST RUN. If it climbs,
  // these come straight back out and the capture becomes a dedicated short session
  // rather than something carried for a whole drive.

// -- CAM_LKAS 0x243 (its LKAS state bits are copied into our own 0x243, and the
// checksum validator compares against it) and CAM_LANEINFO 0x440 (lane age).
// Everything else the camera sends was being pushed into can_rx_q and then
// thrown away by the host, which is pure queue pressure.
//
// MEASURED 2026-08-08: rx_buffer_overflow reached 1,786,680 with the queue
// (CAN_RX_BUFFER_SIZE 2048) filling in ~0.34 s at ~6000 frames/s. Once it is
// permanently full the USB stream degrades and reception stalls silently, taking
// carState with it -- v/rpm/angle frozen for minutes and openpilot unable to
// engage, with nothing logged.
//
// This gates ONLY the host feed, exactly like mazda_host_visible does for bus 0.
// safety_fwd_hook runs EARLIER in can_rx(), so cam->car forwarding still carries
// the camera's full message set -- which matters, because with no harness relay
// the panda is the only path between them.
